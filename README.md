# JSGuruLibraryApp

An app I made during my internship in JSGuru. My task was to create an app for the company's library. Employees can create accounts and view/search available books in the company. They can send requests to borrow books and the admin of the page can accept or reject them. The admin is also in charge of adding/editing/deleting books and categories that are associated to the books accorindingly. 
The app was created without any front-end frameworks, part of my task was to build everything using vanilla javaScript so I grow a feeling of how everything works "under the hood". Because of this fact, my code may deviate from some best practices sometimes for feasibility.
