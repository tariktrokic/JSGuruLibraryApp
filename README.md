# JSGuruLibraryApp

An app I made during my internship at JSGuru. The task was to create a full stack app for the company's internal library. Employees can create accounts (JSON Web Token Authentication) and view/search available books, as well as send borrow requests for them. The app contains an admin panel where it is possible to manage the library by adding/editing/deleting books and categories that are associated with the books accordingly. The admin can also view borrow requests, accept them upon which the user gets a notification, or reject them.
The app was created without any front-end frameworks, part of my task was to build everything using vanilla JavaScript so I grow a feeling for how everything works "under the hood".
